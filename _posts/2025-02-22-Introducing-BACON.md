Bringing Blockchain-Based Incentives to Open Source Security
The open-source ecosystem thrives on collaboration, innovation, and shared knowledge. Yet, contributors often work tirelessly without direct financial incentives. At OWASP BLT, we believe that security and open-source contributions deserve recognition and rewards. That’s why we are introducing **BACON**, a new Bitcoin-based token built on the **Runes protocol**, to incentivize security research and open-source development.
<br>
Why BACON?
<br>
**BACON** is one of the first tokens leveraging the **Runes protocol**, a groundbreaking innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem that enables fungible tokens without relying on additional layers like Ethereum or BRC-20. By adopting this cutting-edge technology within **a year of its release**, OWASP BLT is positioning itself as a pioneer in integrating **Bitcoin-native incentives** for open-source security work.
<br>
We have minted **1 trillion BACON tokens**, which will be used to reward contributions such as:
<br>
Reporting and fixing security vulnerabilities.
<br>
Enhancing security research and development.
<br>
Contributing code, documentation, and improvements to OWASP BLT.
<br>
Engaging in bug bounty programs.
<br>
The Power of Bitcoin Runes
<br>
Unlike traditional blockchain tokens, **Runes** provides an efficient and scalable way to create and manage tokens directly on **Bitcoin's UTXO model**. This ensures:
<br>
**Security:** As a Bitcoin-native protocol, Runes benefits from the highest level of security and decentralization.
<br>
**Simplicity:** No smart contracts or sidechains—Runes operates purely on Bitcoin transactions.
<br>
**Efficiency:** A lightweight implementation that minimizes network congestion and fees.
<br>
How BACON Will Be Distributed
<br>
To ensure fair and meaningful adoption, **BACON** will be distributed through **merit-based incentives** rather than speculation. Some of the key ways to earn BACON include:
<br>
**Bug Bounties:** Security researchers who identify vulnerabilities in OWASP BLT and related projects will be rewarded in BACON.
<br>
**Open Source Contributions:** Developers contributing valuable code, documentation, or security improvements will earn BACON.
<br>
**Community Engagement:** Active participation in discussions, testing, and education initiatives will be recognized.
<br>
The Future of BACON and OWASP BLT
<br>
With **BACON**, we are not just launching a token—we are establishing a **new model for incentivizing open-source security.** Our goal is to make **OWASP BLT** one of the first **open-source organizations** to integrate a **Bitcoin-based incentive mechanism** for developers, researchers, and contributors.
<br>
As the **Bitcoin ecosystem evolves**, we see **BACON** as an opportunity to redefine how **security and open-source development** are rewarded, ensuring a more **sustainable and secure** future for all.
<br>
Join us in shaping this revolution—contribute to **OWASP BLT**, earn **BACON**, and be part of the future of open-source security on Bitcoin!
