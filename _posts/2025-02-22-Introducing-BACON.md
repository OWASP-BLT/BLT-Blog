Bringing Blockchain-Based Incentives to Open Source Security
The open-source ecosystem thrives on collaboration, innovation, and shared knowledge. Yet, contributors often work tirelessly without direct financial incentives. At OWASP BLT, we believe that security and open-source contributions deserve recognition and rewards. That’s why we are introducing BACON, a new Bitcoin-based token built on the Runes protocol, to incentivize security research and open-source development.

Why BACON?
BACON is one of the first tokens leveraging the Runes protocol, a groundbreaking innovation in the Bitcoin ecosystem that enables fungible tokens without relying on additional layers like Ethereum or BRC-20. By adopting this cutting-edge technology within a year of its release, OWASP BLT is positioning itself as a pioneer in integrating Bitcoin-native incentives for open-source security work.

We have minted 1 trillion BACON tokens, which will be used to reward contributions such as:

Reporting and fixing security vulnerabilities.
Enhancing security research and development.
Contributing code, documentation, and improvements to OWASP BLT.
Engaging in bug bounty programs.
The Power of Bitcoin Runes
Unlike traditional blockchain tokens, Runes provides an efficient and scalable way to create and manage tokens directly on Bitcoin's UTXO model. This ensures:

Security: As a Bitcoin-native protocol, Runes benefits from the highest level of security and decentralization.
Simplicity: No smart contracts or sidechains—Runes operates purely on Bitcoin transactions.
Efficiency: A lightweight implementation that minimizes network congestion and fees.
How BACON Will Be Distributed
To ensure fair and meaningful adoption, BACON will be distributed through merit-based incentives rather than speculation. Some of the key ways to earn BACON include:

Bug Bounties: Security researchers who identify vulnerabilities in OWASP BLT and related projects will be rewarded in BACON.
Open Source Contributions: Developers contributing valuable code, documentation, or security improvements will earn BACON.
Community Engagement: Active participation in discussions, testing, and education initiatives will be recognized.
The Future of BACON and OWASP BLT
With BACON, we are not just launching a token—we are establishing a new model for incentivizing open-source security. Our goal is to make OWASP BLT one of the first open-source organizations to integrate a Bitcoin-based incentive mechanism for developers, researchers, and contributors.

As the Bitcoin ecosystem evolves, we see BACON as an opportunity to redefine how security and open-source development are rewarded, ensuring a more sustainable and secure future for all.

Join us in shaping this revolution—contribute to OWASP BLT, earn BACON, and be part of the future of open-source security on Bitcoin!
